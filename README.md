1. The file run_analysis.R should do the following:

   a. Merges the training and the test databases.
   b. Extracts the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
   c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   d. Labels the data.
   e. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

2. Repository structure:

  -README.md, this file.
  -codebook.md, contains the description of variables produced by run_analysis.R
  -run_analysis.R, is the R script that produces the tidyData.txt file
  -tidyData.txt, is the file generated by run_analysis.R, which contains the reshaped data set processed from /project_data
